        The <strong><abbr title="HTML">HyperText Markup Language</abbr> </strong>is the standard markup language for documents
        designed to be displayed in
        a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.

        <b> <acronym title="CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</acronym> </b>is a style sheet language used for describing the
        presentation of a document
        written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS
        is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
        to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
